# To do

Some ideas for improving Otto.

  - Better documentation.
  - Display an error when the user-entered rule (in the rule string field) is
    empty.
  - Implement click-and-drag-to-paint for the game board.
  - Implement a rules dropdown box with some rules from Wikipedia.
    - I'll have to figure out where to put this. Work it into the sketch.
